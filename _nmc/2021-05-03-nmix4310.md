## iOS App Development

NMIX 4310 was truly the first class I've taken that let the creative side of my brain take center stage while programming. Learning SwiftUI for the first time was both challenging and fun. Figuring out little SwiftUI tricks here and there to spice up the looks and performance of the apps I was creating always kept my drive going all semester. SwiftUI allowed me to express myself without many limits. Whenever I came up with an idea, I could usually create exactly what I had envisioned. Also taking this course alongside CSCI 4300 (Human-Computer Interaction) and CSCI 4060 (Android App Development) allowed me to make many connections between what I was learning this semester, leading to even better apps. 

Below are a few examples of apps I've made this semester with links to their GitHub repositories (if you want to check them out).
