## CSCI 4050
CSCI 4050 taught me all about software engineering. From different development processes to domain class diagrams, there was plenty to go over in CSCI 4050. All semester long, I worked alongside a group of other students to develop a working cinema e-booking system from scratch. This involved creating user stories, use cases, prototypes of the UI, the domain class diagram, object relational mapping, and eventually the entire front and backend of the cinema e-booking system itself. We really were an agile team! 

I ended up bearing most of the load for the group and had to teach myself a lot throughout this course. I learned about Springboot, HTML development with Bootstrap, database management using MySQL and phpMyAdmin, and more. I really rounded out my skills greatly as a software developer and engineer. On top of this, I still was learning so much in class about different processes and methods when developing software.

This course had me put my nose to the grindstone, but I can proudly say that it gave me so much experience that I feel confident heading into my first job this coming Fall. Please check out the repo for the cinema e-booking system we developed [here](https://github.com/andreasmarsh/SpringTest3). Thank you!
