## CSCI 1301
CSCI 1301 is where it all began for my coding career. In this class, I learned the basics of Java and programming as a whole. I learned how to break down complex issues into objects and classes and think in the mindset of code development. I was challenged to tackle large problems with new data structures and concepts that we were learning every week in class. From developing a text-based adventure game to a functional blackjack card game with a GUI, 1301 set up the basics that I would continue to build off of throughout college.
