## Task / Problem Definition

In a hybrid synchronous environment, it is oftentimes difficult for the instructor to gauge how well students are interpreting material if they are attending remotely. This issue can cause the teacher to falsely believe that information presented to students has been fully comprehended and can cause the teacher to move on to new topics when some students aren't fully ready. Because of the hybrid model of learning, it is tough to keep track of the progress of students who are learning from home as well as those who are attending in-person classes.

**Seven Stages of Action**:
  - **Goal**: Professors want to make sure that students are learning and mastering the material. 
  - **Execution**: Professor plans lessons to break down material to teach to students. Students attend lectures to learn material that the professor is teaching. 
  - **Evaluation**: Professors in class can see students' reactions to material. The students' reactions let the professor know if they are understanding the material. 

**Users & How They Are Affected**

  - Students are affected by this problem and so are their teachers.
  - The teachers are supposed to ensure that the students understand the required material before moving on to a new topic. The students are supposed to pay attention in class in order to learn the material to do well in the class.
  - A solution to this problem would make the teacher’s job easier because they wouldn’t be stretched so thin trying to take care of both in-person and remote students, and the students would benefit by having a more direct system of learning even while remote.


## Analysis of Existing Solutions

**Describe Existing Solutions**
- Some professors do weekly quizzes to test the students’ knowledge on material taught that week.
  - **Pro**:
    - Students need to keep up with material taught to do well on quizzes. 
    - With online quizzes like with eLC, teachers can view which questions were missed most often and correct lectures and teaching to account for this.
  - **Con**:
    - Quizzes sometimes are not monitored so students may not be keeping academic honesty when taking their quiz.
    - If just a few students do poorly on a quiz, the teacher may not think much of it and move on to new material anyway.
- Office Hours are held every week.
  - **Pro**:
    - Students can get help from their professors if they did not understand the material that was taught.
  - **Con**:
    - Zoom office hours are less efficient than the previous way of face to face.
    - Not all students attend office hours 
    - Students in elementary - highschool may not have access to one on one time with the teacher.
