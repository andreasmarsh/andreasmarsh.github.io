## Task / Problem Definition

In a hybrid synchronous environment, it is oftentimes difficult for the instructor to gauge how well students are interpreting material if they are attending remotely. This issue can cause the teacher to falsely believe that information presented to students has been fully comprehended and can cause the teacher to move on to new topics when some students aren't fully ready. Because of the hybrid model of learning, it is tough to keep track of the progress of students who are learning from home as well as those who are attending in person classes.

**Seven Stages of Action**:
  - **Goal**: Professors want to make sure that students are learning and mastering the material. 
  - **Execution**: Professor plans lessons to break down material to teach to students. Students attend lecture to learn material that the professor is teaching. 
  - **Evaluation**: Professors in class can see students reactions to material. The students' reactions lets a professor know if they are understanding the material. 

**Users & How They Are Affected**

  - Students are affected by this problem and so are their teachers.
  - The teachers are supposed to ensure that the students understand the required material before moving on to a new topic. The students are supposed to pay attention in class in order to learn the material to do well in the class.
  - A solution to this problem would make the teacher’s job easier because they wouldn’t be stretched so thin trying to take care of both in person and remote students, and the students would benefit by having a more direct system of learning even while remote.
