## A. User Stories

### As a Teacher I want to...

  - ask my virtual class a question in order to measure their understanding of the current topic.
  - ask a specific, virtual student a question in order to see if they are paying attention.
  - see the results of past class questions in order to see how my class has been progressing.
  - directly message a student so that I can check on their class progress.
  - check direct messages from my students so that I can stay in contact with them and help them with issues.
  - check the attendance of students in the virtual meeting so that I can see how many students are not attending class regularly.

### As a Student I want to...

  - show the teacher that I am engaged so that they feel like they are teaching to an active audience.
  - demonstrate my understanding or lack of it so that the teacher can appropriately pace the class to the students’ needs. 
  - be able to ask my teacher a question so that I can better understand the current/previous topic.
  - be able to receive assistance during class so that I do not have to use other forms of communication outside of class to reach the teacher.
  - be able to see my previous scores (and the correct answers) so that I can track my progress and use the in-class practice quizzes to study.
 
### Most Relevant User Stories

1. **‘As a Teacher, I want to check direct messages from my students so that I can stay in contact with them and help them with issues.’ & ‘As a teacher, I want to directly message a student so that I can check on their class progress’ & ‘As a Student, I want to be able to receive assistance during class so that I do not have to use other forms of communication outside of class to reach the teacher.’**
  - These user stories are very important because they emphasize the communication elements of our solution that have been lost due to remote learning. A Pew Research Survey found that 90% of people say that communication is the most important skill for children to get ahead in the world today[1]. By creating a solution that increases communication in asynchronous classrooms, students will be able to grow both in their academic learning as well as in their communication skills.
2. **‘As a Teacher, I want to see the results of past class questions in order to see how my class has been progressing’ & ‘As a student, I want to be able to see my previous scores (and the correct answers) so that I can track my progress and use the in-class practice quizzes to study.’**
  - This pair of stories is also very important to our solution because it allows both the instructor and student to view their past mistakes. This allows the instructor to view if many students missed the same questions, and allows the student to see which questions they have missed.
3. **‘As a Teacher, I want to ask my virtual class a question in order to measure their understanding of the current topic.’ &  ‘As a student, I want to demonstrate my understanding or lack of it so that the teacher can appropriately pace the class to the students’ needs.’**
  - This pair of stories is important because it lays out the quiz aspect of our solution. The instructor may ask the entire class a question or single out a student or students to answer a question in front of everybody. The student is then given a prompt to answer the question.

<p>Andreas chose to create a mockup that incorporates elements of all three user story groups. As a response to story group 1, Andreas decided to add a chat feature on the zoom screen of his application similar to that of Twitch.tv so that students would be more likely to engage with the chat during class. Andreas also added the feature to easily send a private chat to the teacher in case a student wished to send a question anonymously during class and also an unmute button in case verbal communication was required. Also, a messages tab exists and functions similar to Outlook but is separated based on class inboxes, allowing conversations to carry on outside of class time between both teachers and students. As a response to story group 2, Andreas created a Grades tab where students can review past assignments ranging from previous in-class assignments to tests/quizzes. As a response to story group 3, Andreas created a wireframe for a pop-up quiz overlay that the teacher could turn on mid-lecture to access how students are comprehending information as well as an Assignments tab that displays active assignments to be done outside of class. By having all of these functions built into one application, students will be less likely to miss information that is crucial to their class performance and will be more likely to engage with their teachers as there are fewer barriers between the student and teacher thanks to this application.</p>

<ul>
<li>(Student's Screen) This page provides the student's previous questions answered and results. An explanation is also provided in case the student answered incorrectly. This is a good concept so all questions answered can be accessed together whenever the student wants to.</li>
<li>(Teacher's Screen) With a pie chart statistic, the teacher can easily distinguish the class's response from a question in class. If there is more answer variation, that means the teacher can go over the topic next time in class.</li>
<li>(Questions and Quiz) This design was chosen because it's a simple UI that asks the student a question with four multiple choice options. Based on the answer selected the class results screen will be updated on the teacher's end, and eventually the student's screen once the whole class has answered.</li>
<li>(Communication) It was important to ensure a simple and efficient messaging system between the teacher and the student. With a chat bar, the student can send messages privately during class and wait for a response from the teacher when he/she gets time. The teacher can also provide feedback on the student's class progress.</li>
