## A. User Stories

### As a Teacher...

  - I want to ask my virtual class a question in order to measure their understanding of the current topic.
  - I want to ask a specific, virtual student a question in order to see if they are paying attention.
  - I want to see the results of past class questions in order to see how my class has been progressing.
  - I want to directly message a student so that I can check on their class progress.
  - I want to check direct messages from my students so that I can stay in contact with them and help them with issues.
  - I want to check the attendance of students in the virtual meeting so that I can see how many students are not attending class regularly.

### As a Student...

  - I want to show the teacher that I am engaged so that they feel like they are teaching to an active audience.
  - I want to demonstrate my understanding or lack of it so that the teacher can appropriately pace the class to the students’ needs. 
  - I want to be able to ask my teacher a question so that I can better understand the current/previous topic.
  - I want to be able to receive assistance during class so that I do not have to use other forms of communication outside of class to reach the teacher.
  - I want to be able to see my previous scores (and the correct answers) so that I can track my progress and use the in-class practice quizzes to study.
 
### Most Relevant User Stories

1. ‘As a Teacher, I want to check direct messages from my students so that I can stay in contact with them and help them with issues.’ & ‘As a teacher, I want to directly message a student so that I can check on their class progress’ & ‘As a Student, I want to be able to receive assistance during class so that I do not have to use other forms of communication outside of class to reach the teacher.’
  - These user stories are very important because they emphasize the communication elements of our solution that have been lost due to remote learning. A Pew Research Survey found that 90% of people say that communication is the most important skill for children to get ahead in the world today. By creating a solution that increases communication in asynchronous classrooms, students will be able to grow both in their academic learning as well as in their communication skills. 
2. ‘As a Teacher, I want to see the results of past class questions in order to see how my class has been progressing’ & ‘As a student, I want to be able to see my previous scores (and the correct answers) so that I can track my progress and use the in-class practice quizzes to study.’
  - This pair of stories is also very important to our solution because it allows both the instructor and student to view their past mistakes. This allows the instructor to view if many students missed the same questions, and allows the student to see which questions they have missed.
3. ‘As a Teacher, I want to ask my virtual class a question in order to measure their understanding of the current topic.’ &  ‘As a student, I want to demonstrate my understanding or lack of it so that the teacher can appropriately pace the class to the students’ needs.’
  - This pair of stories is important because it lays out the quiz aspect of our solution. The instructor may ask the entire class a question or single out a student or students to answer a question in front of everybody. The student is then given a prompt to answer the question.
