## Thanks for checking out my site!
**Hopefully it allows you a glimpse into who I am 
and what I think about üòÄ**

Formally, I am a third-year honors student at the University of Georgia studying Computer Science and have training and experience in Java, C++, and Swift programming.

I love coding and seeing my ideas come to life on a screen.

In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar and relaxing with my friends, be that chilling at home, going on a hike, or whatever the day holds. Recently my friends and I even created a band called [Virginia Avenue](https://open.spotify.com/artist/19xwlFclYPc41jLJa4vEeH?si=n87Sj7zQSV6wizNcbRxW_g), check us out sometime üòÅ.

I love, and oftenmtimes catch myself, thinking about the *~why~*. That is why things work the way they do, and also why we do things the way we do. I'm always trying to figure out any possible improvements to the seemingly set-in-stone functions that make up the world all around us. This drives me to keep learning everyday and approach problems I may run into with an eagerness to solve.
