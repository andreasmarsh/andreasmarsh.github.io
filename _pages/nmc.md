## A Way of Connecting Code to the World Around Us

The New Media Certificate (offered by the [New Media Institute](https://mynmi.net/about/)) has allowed me to expand my imagination when it comes to creating applications. Coming into the program as a third-year CS major, I had a lot of experience coding what my professors wanted but not what I wanted. I'd found success in fitting the mold but need a new challenge to test me in new ways. The New Media Institute was just that.

By taking courses focused more on discovery than being told what to do, I learned how to apply my knowledge in new ways and think outside the box when tackling problems.

Most of my work recently has been in designing and creating mobile applications. I have taken courses that discuss Human-Computer Interaction, iOS app development, Android app development, Data Structures, and much more. The know-how of my CS background paired with the creative thinking of New Media has given me the right skill set to create applications that are useful, are well designed, and, most importantly, are projects that I'm proud of. 

Feel free to explore below and check out the courses Iâ€™ve taken so far as part of my New Media journey! ðŸ˜„
