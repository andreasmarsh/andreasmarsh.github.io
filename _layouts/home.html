<p><strong>Hey There! ðŸ‘‹ </strong>
  <br>
  My name is Andreas and this is my website. Feel free to stay a while. 
  <br>
  I recommend checking out the about tab somwhere up there ðŸ‘† to learn a little about me first. But if you don't have the time then feel free to take a 
  look at my blog and resume, or if you want to dive into what I've been working on recently take a peak at the NMIX or HCI tabs.
  <br>
  Hope you enjoy it!</p>
