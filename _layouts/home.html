<p><strong>Hey There! ðŸ‘‹ </strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  My name is Andreas and this is my website.
  <br>
  Feel free to stay a while. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I recommend checking out the <em>About</em> tab somwhere up there ðŸ‘† to learn a little about me first.
  <br>
  But if you don't have the time then feel free to take a look at my blog and resume, or if you want to dive into what I've been working on recently take a peak at the <em>NMIX</em> or <em>HCI</em> tabs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hope you enjoy it!</p>
