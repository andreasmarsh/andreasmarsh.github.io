<p><strong>Hey There! ðŸ‘‹ </strong> My name is Andreas and this is my website. Feel free to stay a while. I recommend checking 
  about the about tab up ðŸ‘† there to learn a little about me first. But if you don't have the time then feel free to take a 
  look at my blog and resume, or if you want to dive into what I've been working on recently take a peak at the NMIX or HCI tabs. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
